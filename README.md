## Some notes about the idea

Title: "Wil I become a data scientist?"

I want to do a 
Cluster analysis of data scientist profiles (in my network) first of all and have a look and 
visualize distributions of sets of features 
- Year of experience before getting the data scientist title
- Background
- stability as a job

I would liket  identify a set of features (even using endorsment and skills) for clustering data scientists and see 
how out class profile ( or even just mean ) matches against the features of successful data scientist

Cluster  pool of student across the other clusters of data scientis


First
Look at  the data i can get:
- how many data scientists in my network

Get the data from LinkedIn first using API

Think about the data:
Is the number too small?
Is it too high?
What can I get with the API?

Plus: I'd like to really learn to use MongoDB  for this 

Visualization of clusters and interactive features weight / selection  
- years of experience
- number of companies
- years as data scientist 
- .....


## Technical notes.

I've been testing with this APIs in Python:

Problems getting the off network data..


## The problem now is the amount of data i can have..
