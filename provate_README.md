## Some notes about the idea

Title: " Wil you become a datascientist"?

I want to do a 
Cluster analysis of data scientist profiles (in my network) first of all and have a look and 
visualize distributions of 
- Year of experience before getting the data scientist title
- Background
- stability as a job

Interesting to identify a set of features (even using endorsment and skills) for clustering and for compute distnces

To cluster out pool of student acros the other clusters of data scientis

Scary stuff : how likely will I become a data scientist ?

First:
Look at how many data scientists in my network

Get the data from LinkedIn
- markup the Zipfian folks in some way

Issues:
Is the number too small?
Is it too high?
What can I get with the API?

Plus: I'd like to really learn to use MongoDB as a side

Visualization of clusters (interactive with weight on 
- years of experience
- number of companies
- years as data scientist
